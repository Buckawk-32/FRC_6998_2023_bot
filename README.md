# FRC_6998_2023_bot
 FRC_6998, Season 2023 robot

## Description
This is my code for each of the generations. Even though I didn't deploy nor had my code on the finsihed robot, this was my way of learning FRC coding, by coding for each generation and side robots as well. I was just a rookie learing how to write the FRC code.

## Generation No.1 Insights
The one thing that is the biggest change is the arm. We are taking out the arm for an elevator for the mock competition we have. We are also making our robot much less complicated, removing the transfer subsystem and arm subsystem completely, making programming much more easier

## Generation No.2 Insights
Gen 2's claw was quite hard to grab hold of the cone as it would need to go up and down, and the slider had much problems than we had anticipated
 
## Generation No.3
Gen 3 consists of a self-made, thick, linear slider and a claw at the end of the slider

1. SliderSubsystem
   - 1 Neo 500 in the center pulling 
   - 2 Neo 500 on the sides pulling as well

2. GripperSubsystem
   - 1 Neo 500 turning the claw
   - 2 pnuematic pistons closing and opening the claw

## Generation No.3 Insights
We realise that Gen 3 could have been better with a ligth weight intake, but it doesn't matter because the we got into Houston World Championship and won many awards and the FRC season has ended.

## Credit
The real programmer of the 6998 final robot is @MilkTeaBox.

Not to only metion, our older senior programmer which helped a lot on our robot, @rainchi

Without them, the code for the final robot wouldn't exist.

## Contributions
Thanks to a lot of google and github (team 364, 138, 2168), WPI documentation, and the seniors in our team.
