 FRC_6998, Season 2023 robot

## Generation No.1
This is the Generation 1 code for the Gen 1 robot. This is still a early prototype code. Each week should have a new generation of code.

## The current Goal
Finish the Arm subsystem and the Transfer Subsytem, once that is done, we need to test it with operator and driver controls.

## Contributions
Thanks to a lot of google and github (team 326, 138, 2168), WPI documentation, Limelight documentation, and the seniors in our team.
