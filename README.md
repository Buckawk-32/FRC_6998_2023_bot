# FRC_6998_2023_bot
 FRC_6998, Season 2023 robot

## Generation No.1 Insights
The one thing that is the biggest change is the arm. We are taking out the arm for an elevator for the mock competition we have. We are also making our robot much less complicated, removing the transfer subsystem and arm subsystem completely, making programming much more easier

## Generation No.2 Insights
Gen 2's claw was quite hard to grab hold of the cone as it would need to go up and down, and the slider had much problems than we had anticipated
 
## Generation No.3
Gen 3" consists of a self-made, thick, linear slider and a claw at the end of the slider

1. SliderSubsystem
