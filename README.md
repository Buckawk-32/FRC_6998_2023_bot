# FRC_6998_2023_bot
 FRC_6998, Season 2023 robot

## Generation No.1, Insights
The one thing that is the most biggest change is about the arm. We are taking out the arm for an elevator for the mock competition we have. We are also making our robot much less complicated, removing the transfer subsystem and arm subsystem completely, making programming much more easier

## Generation No.2
Gen 2 consists of and integrated claw / intake attached on to the elevator on a swerve drive chassis
 
- Intake
    - 1 motor for the intake of cone
    - 1 motor for the wheels uptop
    - 2 motors for the rotation of the intake
    - 1 motor for the position of the intake on the slider

- Slider / Elevator
    - 1 motor to increase and decrease ther length of the elvator

- Swerve Drive Subsystem
    - Already done, look at the Swerve drive training repository

### Problems to fix
1. Controller config
2. Intake should have a range of movement using kposition
3. Testing needs to be quickly done for mock competition

## The Current Goal
Finish Gen 2

## Objectives
Finish code by 2/15
Finish testing by 2/17
Mock Competition on 2/18

## Contributions
Thanks to a lot of google and github (team 364, 138, 2168), WPI documentation, and the seniors in our team.
